# Data Dealer

Goals: 

1. generate browsable (hierarchical ?) document collection summary to be able to explore document collection in various dimensions, e.g. portal/publisher, country, language, category/topic.

2. pick discriminative terms to partition the space of documents (not too general, i.e. present in all documents of the collection, and not too specific, i.e. present in a single document in the collection), annotate each document with good search terms (ngrams) which reflect its semantics, that **carry semantic meaning not a random (rare) corpus-specific collocation**.

3. navigate (suggest, guide user) through good (!) search terms (hierarchy?) which plays the role of the proxy anchoring to the underlying document clusters in the collection.

The recommended reading order resem- bles the human approach of learning as we typically start our path to knowledge from more general documents that help us under- stand the domain and then we proceed with more specific, more specialized documents to increase our knowledge of the matter."
