# Data dealer

Goal: generate browsable hierarchical document collection summary, suggest search terms

Facets: portal/publisher, category (topic)

* explore by portal/publisher, e.g. country, state: hawaii, portal: http://data.gov.uk/
* how to infer category/topic/clusters ? e.g. with a topic model
* discriminative keywords, pick keywords candidates that carry semantics
* clustering -> space partitioning

The recommended reading order resem- bles the human approach of learning as we typically start our path to knowledge from more general documents that help us under- stand the domain and then we proceed with more specific, more specialized documents to increase our knowledge of the matter."
